# 🎨 AirCanvas – Draw with Your Finger in the Air!

**AirCanvas** is a real-time Computer Vision project that allows you to draw on a virtual canvas by simply moving your finger in the air! Using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**, this project detects your hand landmarks and tracks the tip of your index finger to draw lines on a canvas. It's a fun and interactive project that showcases the power of gesture recognition and real-time hand tracking — a perfect addition to your Machine Learning or Computer Vision portfolio.

## 🧰 Installation

### Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.7
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirCanvas.git
cd AirCanvas

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Make sure your system has a webcam.

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python air_canvas.py
```

- Move your **index finger** in front of the camera.
- Use your **thumb + index finger** gesture to **stop drawing**.
- Tap the **color buttons** on top of the screen with your finger to change color.
- Tap on **CLEAR** to reset the canvas.
- Press **`q`** to quit the application.

## 🖼️ UI Layout

| Button   | Function                |
|----------|-------------------------|
| CLEAR    | Clears the canvas       |
| BLUE     | Sets drawing color blue |
| GREEN    | Sets drawing color green|
| RED      | Sets drawing color red  |
| YELLOW   | Sets drawing color yellow|

## 🙋‍♂️ How It Works

- The webcam captures frames.
- MediaPipe detects **21 hand landmarks**.
- The **index finger tip (Landmark 8)** is tracked.
- When the index finger is extended, its position is recorded.
- If it passes over a button area (like "CLEAR" or "RED"), the action is triggered.
- Finger positions are stored in `deque`s to preserve smooth lines.

## 📌 To-Do / Improvements

- Add GUI-based color selector.
- Add eraser mode.
- Support multi-hand drawing.
- Export drawings as images.
- Make the app mobile-friendly.
